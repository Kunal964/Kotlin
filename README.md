# Kotlin OOP Concepts

In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Kotlin. We'll cover the following topics:

## Getter and Setter
Kotlin provides a concise syntax for declaring properties and their getters and setters. The getter and setter are automatically generated for mutable (`var`) and read-only (`val`) properties. Custom accessors can be defined for more complex behavior.

## Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit features (properties and methods) from another class. In Kotlin, all classes are final by default; to make a class inheritable, it must be declared as `open` or `abstract`.

## IS-A Relation
The IS-A relationship is expressed through inheritance in Kotlin. It signifies that a subclass is a type of its superclass.

## HAS-A Relation
The HAS-A relationship is also known as composition. It signifies that a class contains a reference to another class or includes another class's capabilities.

## Super Keyword
The `super` keyword in Kotlin is used to refer to the immediate parent class of a subclass. It allows access to the superclass's functions and properties.
